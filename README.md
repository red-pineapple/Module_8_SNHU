How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? 
I would interpret user needs by first identifying the problem that they are attempting to address. Asking the 5 'whys' helps with identifying and interpreting them. Afterwards, sorting these wants and needs in order of importance provides a clear path on implementation. Working on the most important first, and later incorporating the least important (if needed) will help turn the attempt at an implementation into an actual implementation.

How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Creating user stories gives a clear definition of what is trying to be accomplished, and why. Giving definition of what type of user the story is addressing (user, administrator, seller, etc), what they are attempting, and what they are attempting to accomplish gives a clear path of the user needs and how important they are. This helps prevent scope creep, and keeps the project lean and moving forward. Using user stories also assists in testing, and test driven development, as it gives the definition of what is supposed to happen within the user story. An example would be: User clicks withdrawal at atm, because they want to pull money out of their account.

How do I approach developing programs?
I approach developing programs by addressing what concerns need met. Afterwards, I collect requirements, and then I attempt to gather domain knowledge in order to address the requirements. Once that is done, I make a rough draft of what requirements are most important to least important. I select what requirements I would like to address first in most important, and what is reasonable in a given time frame and start scaffolding out my project.

What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I hope to incorporate all aspects that I can from the agile processes. They are all useful in their own way. One of the most benefitial that I hope to incorporate immediately is transparency and collaboration. Transparency allows a better working environment, as well as nurtures collaboration. The more transparent that I am, the easier collaboration becomes netween my colleagues, and better quality work can be achieved with less effort.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
I feel that to be a good team member, collaboration and support are a must have quality. When you support your team members and collaborate when possible, you can build on eachothers knowledge, learn new development styles, and learn how eachother work. This helps foster a higher morale, and by learning how we work together, address any short comings and become a high-productive team.
